" The default is to move files that are deleted with dd or :d to

" a file extension.
" :filetype pattern1,pattern2 defaultprogram,program2
" :fileviewer pattern1,pattern2 consoleviewer
" The other programs for the file type can be accessed with the :file command
" The command macros %f, %F, %d, %F may be used in the commands.
" The %a macro is ignored.  To use a % you must put %%.

" For automated FUSE mounts, you must register an extension with :file[x]type
" in one of following formats:
"
" :filetype extensions FUSE_MOUNT|some_mount_command using %SOURCE_FILE and %DESTINATION_DIR variables
" %SOURCE_FILE and %DESTINATION_DIR are filled in by vifm at runtime.
" A sample line might look like this:
" :filetype *.zip,*.jar,*.war,*.ear FUSE_MOUNT|fuse-zip %SOURCE_FILE %DESTINATION_DIR
"
" :filetype extensions FUSE_MOUNT2|some_mount_command using %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR variables
" %PARAM and %DESTINATION_DIR are filled in by vifm at runtime.
" A sample line might look like this:
" :filetype *.ssh FUSE_MOUNT2|sshfs %PARAM %DESTINATION_DIR
" %PARAM value is filled from the first line of file (whole line).
" Example first line for SshMount filetype: root@127.0.0.1:/
