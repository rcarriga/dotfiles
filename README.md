# vimrc
Just a simple vimrc

Current Setup: 
  - Basic Plugins
      - NERDTree for file structure with git plugin
      - NERD Comment for commenting
      - Tagbar for showing ctags
      - FZF for file searching
      - Surround for... well surrounding with quotes, brackets etc.
      - Gitgutter to show git diff beside lines
      - Lightline for better status bar
      - One half colorscheme (Copy of Atom One colorscheme)
  - Python Plugins:
      - ALE using pylint, flake8 & autopep8
      - vim-lsp using pyls for autocomplete and hovering
      - SimpylFold for folding
      - ALE can be configured for virtualenvs: Use ":help g:ale_virtualenv_dir_names"
      - Pydocstring to generate docstrings
  - Terraform Plugins
      - vim-terrform for syntax highlighting and formatting
   
Work in Progress:
  - Haskell Development Plugins
      
      
**DISCLAIMER:** This setup is very thrown together and uses both ALE and vim-lsp for various features because I couldn't get either to work perfectly.
