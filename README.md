# vimrc
Just a simple vimrc

Current Setup: 
  - Basic Plugins:
      - NERDTree for file structure with git plugin.
      - NERD Comment for commenting.
      - Tagbar for showing ctags.
      - FZF for file searching.
      - Surround for... well surrounding with quotes, brackets etc.
      - Gitgutter to show git diff beside lines.
      - Lightline for better status bar.
      - One half colorscheme (Copy of Atom One colorscheme).
  - Python Plugins:
      - Pylint linting using Syntastic (Be aware this is not done asynchronously so can be a little slow, but is more stable than ALE).
      - Vim-lsp and pyls for all other language server stuff (IE: Flake8 linting, jedi autocomplete, black and yapf formatting etc).
      - SimpylFold for folding.
      - Pydocstring to generate docstrings
      - Vim-virtualenv for virtualenv support.
  - Terraform Plugins:
      - vim-terrform for syntax highlighting and formatting
   
Work in Progress:
  - Haskell Development Plugins
